Bug 27446932 : DEFAULT POSITION = SIEBEL ADMINISTRATOR CAUSES ASGNSRVR TO GO OFFLINE

Till the bug is fixed, the work around is:

Rename position(s) having the same name leaving only one position having Name = Siebel Administration, and restart AsgnSrvr component.

In this case, rename one of Siebel Administrator to a different name, and I rename the one having Position ROW_ID = '04-HKCSE' to Siebel Administrator2. To do that, log into application, go to Administration - Group > Positions, query for Position by entering ""Siebel Administrator"" (name enclosed in double quotes) in Position field, 2 records are returned:

Division                     Position                   ROW_ID
Siebel Administration  Siebel Administrator  0-5200
Default Organization  Siebel Administrator   04-HKCSE

Choose the record having  ROW_ID = 04-HKCSE  (use Help > About Record, or Menu > About Record)
Update Position = Siebel Administrator2 for ROW_ID = '04-HKCSE'.
After that query for Position by entering ""Siebel Administrator"" (name enclosed in double quotes) in Position field, and only one record is returned.
Restart AsgnSrvr component.
AsgnSrvr is successfully started up.

The reason for renaming ROW_ID = '04-HKCSE' and not ROW_ID = '0-5200' is because the vanilla Siebel Administrator position is the one with ROW_ID = '0-5200' which should be left as is and should not be renamed.",,,,2,Siebel CRM,ASGMNGRQ2968,AMBTCHMDQ2968,HOUR,1,,"Assigment Manager Component is offline

Solution:

1. Execute below query to identify active workspace Id and Repository Id of the application

SELECT ROW_ID ""Workspace Id"",REPOSITORY_ID FROM SIEBEL.S_WORKSPACE WHERE NAME='MAIN' AND ROWNUM<=1 ORDER BY CREATED DESC

Note workspace Id and repository Id which can be used in below SQL

 2. Use below sql to identify the latest version of the active workspace by replacing <Workspace Id> and <Repository Id> values 

SELECT VERSION_NUM ""Workspace Version Number"",WS_ID ""Workspace Id"" FROM SIEBEL.S_WS_VERSION WHERE WS_ID=<Workspace Id> AND REPOSITORY_ID=<Repository Id> AND ROWNUM=1 ORDER BY VERSION_NUM DESC

Note down the version number and workspace id from above sql
  

3. Following SQL can be used to validate if any of the system workflows are in-active in S_RR_WORKFLOW run time table:

SELECT

T1.NAME,
T1.COMPILED_OBJ_DEFN

FROM

ORDER BY

T1.NAME, T1.VERSION_NUM DESC

 If above query is fetching any result, Perform following steps to activate the identified workflows:

1. Copy the workflow name from above sql and login to Siebel Tools in Development environment

2. Create a developer workspace and query for the workflow name identified in step.1

3. Activate the workflow by un-checking ""Inactive"" flag

2. When you are using secure protocol for IMAP and POP3 using JavaMail customer should obtain the public certificate AND public Root CA certificate that signed the Email Server's certificate.

a. This applies only if the Profiles parameter Enable SSL for IMAP or Enable TLS for IMAP = TRUE or Enable SSL for POP3 or Enable TLS for POP3 = TRUE. If no secure protocols are been used this step can be skipped

b. The public certificate for the IMAP or POP3 Server must be imported into the Siebel Server Container running the Communication Inbound Receiver component.

c. The location of the Siebel Server Container Truststore can be verified in SIEBEL_ROOT\applicationcontainer_internal\conf\server.xml and search for parameter ""truststoreFile"" and ""truststorePass""

d. Execute the keytool command to import the public certificate AND parent public Root CA certificate for the POP3 or IMAP Server for example from Windows command prompt on Siebel Server:
set JAVA_HOME=C:\Siebel\ses\jre
set PATH=%JAVA_HOME%\bin;%PATH%
keytool -import -alias outlook365 -file outlook365.cer -keystore c:\Siebel\ses\applicationcontainer_internal\siebelcerts\siebeltruststore.jks
keytool -import -alias outlook365ca -file outlook365digicert.cer -keystore c:\Siebel\ses\applicationcontainer_internal\siebelcerts\siebeltruststore.jks
It will prompt for the truststore password, enter the password identified on step 3. above.

e. After importing the certificate the Siebel Server Application Container must be restarted for the container load the new truststore in memory

3. Create the new parameter ""Mail Servlet URL"" for Internet SMTP/IMAP Server and Internet SMTP/POP3 Server drivers:

a. Navigate to Site Map > Administration - Communications Communications Driver and Profiles

b. On Communications Drivers list applet query for ""Internet SMTP*""
c. On Driver Parameters child tab click on + to add a new Driver Parameter:

4. For the new parameter set:
Name = Mail Servlet URL

Required = checked

Default Value = http://localhost:<Siebel Server Container HTTP port for server running Communication Inbound Receiver component>/siebel/mail. The http port can be verify in SIEBEL_ROOT\applicationcontainer_internal\conf\server.xml and check the line that defines the http port for the container (search for string ""protocol=""HTTP/1.1"""" and check the line that is not commented out.",,,,3,Siebel CRM,CMSRVMLQ2968,CMMDRVRSQ2968,WEEK,MON,Accounting to Financial Reports: Reporting,"Customer updating to Siebel CRM 21.3 and later must create a new Internet SMTP/IMAP Server or Internet SMTP/POP3 Server driver parameter to support the new 64bit Email Driver, otherwise it will stop working.",Siebel - CRM,Interaction
